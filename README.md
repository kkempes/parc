# parc

parc is a probabilistic sequencer/arpeggiator.

created by: tehn

four channel, sends midi notes and cc data. sends and accepts sync.

each channel has dynamic loop lengths and timing multipliers.

similar to a normal step sequencer, except when a step contains more than one option. where normally a chord would be triggered, parc selects at random one of the choices. step data is set and selected similarly for velocity, sub (retrigger variations with re-randomizing), and line (cc output, with smoothing and range specification.)

slightly more documentation inside the patch. more to come, with screenshots, video, and proper walkthrough.
